# E_Commerce-Churn-Prediction (FINAL PROJECT by SRIKANDI)
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict customer churn in order to proactively address potential losses and manage company costs effectively. Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their services, can significantly impact a company's revenue and operational costs. By predicting churn in advance, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies and optimize resource allocation.
